> Upstate Mesh is a community group of makers and tech enthusiasts tinkering with an open source, solar-powered mesh network in Upstate New York's Capital District. A mesh network acts like a regional text messaging system. It's perfect for hiking, camping, emergency preparedness, or just trying new off-grid technology! - [Upstate Mesh](https://www.upstatemesh.org/)
