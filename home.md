# <img src="/um.webp" alt="meshcore_logo" width="32" height="32"> What Is Upstate Mesh?

> Upstate Mesh is a community group of makers and tech enthusiasts tinkering with an open source, solar-powered mesh network in Upstate New York's Capital District. A mesh network acts like a regional text messaging system. It's perfect for hiking, camping, emergency preparedness, or just trying new off-grid technology! - [Upstate Mesh](https://www.upstatemesh.org/)


We use both Meshtastic and MeshCore at Upstate Mesh. A lot of us even have devices for both! Our goal is to build out and support resilient community driven mesh networks regardless of the protocol or device firmware.
