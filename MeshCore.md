# Getting Started With MeshCore

## What Is MeshCore?

> MeshCore is a multi platform system for enabling secure text based communications utilising LoRa radio hardware. It can be used for Off-Grid Communication, Emergency Response & Disaster Recovery, Outdoor Activities, Tactical Security including law enforcement and private security and also IoT sensor networks. - [MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk/)

In short MeshCore is software that runs on various kinds of hardware that have integrated LoRa radios. In even simpler terms think of MeshCore like an operating system like Anroid or iOS and the LoRa hardware like an iPhone or Galaxy S phone.

## Device Roles

There are a few kinds of MeshCore devices that server different functions on the mesh network:

* **Companion Bluetooth** - LoRa board that pairs with a phone or computer via bluetooth to send text messages from the phone or computer over the LoRa radio.
* **Companion USB** - LoRa board that pairs with a phone or computer via USB to send text messages from the phone or computer over the LoRa radio.
* **Repeater** - A standalone LoRa board that repeats incoming packets to the wider mesh network. Often paired with strong antenna and solar pannels to run coninously outdoors.
* **Room Server** - Room servers store message history on them and push the stored messages to users. Room servers allow roaming users to come back later and retrieve message that were recieved while the user was out of range.

The most common devices are `Companion Bluetooth/USB` and `Repeater`.
